Enclosed you will find projects completed during my time at the Software Guild. 

For projects that better display my design abilities I encourage you to visit:

https://www.MusicNearMe.org - I do not have my code available on my public gitHub for this project. It was created using
html/css/javascript/java/mySQL/AWS/Framework7. Users can sign up and create a band profile or they can subscribe to be
a local venue and add upcoming events. Event pages include uploaded pictures and can feature a band that has signed up 
for the service. 

TouchCount - (TEMP) TouchCount is a demo program I put together for a potential lighting audit client. The idea is that
a user takes inventory of the existing lighting system via a series of touch buttons. I used html/css/javascript/java/mySQL/Framework7
in this project. Should this be revisited there are several changes I'd love to tell you about.  

SuperheroSightings - This project involved allowing users to visit the site and add information about sightings around town. 
User can create a Hero and then create sightings or associate them with organizations and locations. 

VendingMachineREST - In this project we were provided with the back end of the project and were to use AJAx calls to retrieve the
needed information. 

FlooringMastery - This was an early project that reads information from a local file and the program pulls information from
local text files. Orders are stored in folders specific to their date. It would be terrible in the work place but was a good
exercise.
